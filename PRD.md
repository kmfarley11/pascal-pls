# Project Requirements Document

## Overview

The intent of this project is to create a website that looks clean and brings simple joy by randomly providing one quote at a time from Animal Crossings: New Horizon's Pascal character.

The list of quotes may be found at https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Pascal#New_Horizons, but I want to design a nice web app to present a random quote (preferably without frequent collision/redundancy) on a daily or by-the-click basis.

I want this tool for a few reasons
1. to create something nice for my fiance 😊
2. to explore vibe coding a bit more myself for the purpose of clean UI/UX design
3. potentially to explore UI/UX design with a different framework or look/feel than i'm used to

## Goals & Objectives

The core outcome of the product should be a simple-to-deploy client-only web app to randomize pascal quotes. (Leveraging github pages seems simplest for this deployment.) The product should have a simple / clean look & feel reminiscient of the ocean, animal crossing (new horizons), and pascal specifically.

This application should make my fiance smile and potentially bring more joy to the internet lol.

This experience should give me more familiarity with vibe coding for frontend app design & development.

Success will be somewhat subjective because of these points, but it may be measured by how busy the UI is. We'll want interactive elements be relatively minimal and seamless, and for the presented quotes to be easily readable.
